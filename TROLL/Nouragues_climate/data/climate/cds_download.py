# Script to download nc files from CDS - model ERA5-LAND
# Script based on the API request section at (end of the webpage) https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=download

# ATTENTION: the file ~/.cdsapirc needs to be well configured. See instructions at: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api
