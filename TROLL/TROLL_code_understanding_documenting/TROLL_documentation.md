# ðŸŒ¿ TROLL Model Documentation


## Main function

The main function serves as the entry point of the TROLL model. **It initializes** the model, processes input parameters, and executes the main simulation loop.

### Overview and Description 

#### **1. Initial Setup and Configuration**  

##### **MPI Initialization (if enabled)**  
- Checks if the code was compiled with MPI support (`#ifdef MPI`).  
- If enabled:  
  - Initializes the MPI environment (`MPI_Init`).  
  - Retrieves the process rank (`MPI_Comm_rank`) and the total number of processes (`MPI_Comm_size`).  
- If MPI is not enabled:  
  - Sets `mpi_rank = 0` and `mpi_size = 1`, indicating single-process execution.  

##### **Command-Line Argument Processing**  
- Iterates through the programâ€™s command-line arguments (`argc`, `argv`).  
- Identifies and extracts input and output file names based on specific flags:  
  - `-i`: General input file.  
  - `-o`: Output file.  
  - `-m`: Climate input file.  
  - `-s`: Species input file.  
  - `-f`: Inventory data file.  
- Stores file names in corresponding variables (`inputfile`, `inputfile_climate`, `outputfile`, etc.).  

##### **Input File Reading and Parameter Initialization**  
- Reads configuration data and model parameters from the input files using:  
  - `ReadInputGeneral()`  
  - `ReadInputPointcloud()`  
  - `ReadInputInventory()`  
- Initializes the random number generator (`gsl_rng`).  
- Creates a log file for simulation details.  
- Calls initialization functions:  
  - `Initialise()` â€“ Sets up global model parameters and call input functions.
  - `InitialiseOutputStreams()` â€“ Prepares output streams.  
  - `AllocMem()` â€“ Allocates memory for dynamic variables.  
- If the ABC module is enabled, it initializes related data.  

##### **Initial Information Display**  
- Prints simulation parameters such as CO2 concentration, species count, and active modules.  

---

#### **2. Simulation Evolution Loop**  

###### **Main Simulation Loop**  
- Runs a `for` loop for `nbiter` iterations, representing simulation time steps.  
- In each iteration:  
  - Calls `Evolution()` to update the model state.  
  - Measures execution time for performance analysis.  
  - If visualization is enabled, calls `OutputVisual()` at predefined intervals.  
  - If the ABC module is enabled, updates transmittance and outputs using:  
    - `UpdateTransmittanceCHM_ABC()`  
    - `OutputABC()`  
    - `UpdateDBHtrackingABC()`  

##### **Intermediate and Final Data Output**  
- Generates simulation state snapshots (`OutputSnapshot()`) at key time points (initial, intermediate, final).  
- If extended outputs are enabled, calls:  
  - `OutputLAI()` â€“ Outputs Leaf Area Index data.  
  - `OutputCHM()` â€“ Outputs Canopy Height Model data.  
- If inventory output is enabled, saves soil water content data.  

---

#### **3. Finalization and Cleanup**  

##### **Final Information Display**  
- Prints the number of surviving trees at the end of the simulation.  
- Calculates and displays total execution time.  

##### **Memory Cleanup and Program Termination**  
- Closes output files (`CloseOutputs()`).  
- Releases allocated memory (`FreeMem()`).  
- If MPI is enabled, finalizes the MPI environment (`MPI_Finalize()`).  
- Terminates the program (`exit()`).  

---

### OBS:
```cpp
for(int argn=1; argn<argc; argn++){ // Arguments of the input and output files
    if(*argv[argn] == '-'){
        switch(*(argv[argn]+1)){
Explanation of Each Component:
for(int argn=1; argn<argc; argn++):
```

This is a for loop that iterates through the command-line arguments passed to the program.
argn is initialized to 1 because argv[0] is typically the name of the program itself, and we want to skip it to process the actual arguments.
The loop continues as long as argn is less than argc, which is the total number of command-line arguments.
After each iteration, argn is incremented by 1.
if(*argv[argn] == '-'):

This condition checks if the current argument (pointed to by argv[argn]) starts with a '-'.
In command-line arguments, options or flags usually start with a '-', indicating that this argument is a command-line option rather than a regular input or output file.
switch(*(argv[argn]+1)):

This is a switch statement that evaluates the character immediately following the '-' in the command-line argument.
*(argv[argn] + 1) dereferences the pointer to get the second character of the argument string (the one right after the '-').
The switch statement allows you to handle different command-line options based on what follows the '-'.


### Inputs

The input files, besides general parameter are called inside function `Initialise()`, for example: `ReadInputSpecies()`, `ReadInputClimate()`, `ReadInputDailyvar` and `ReadInputSoil`

#### Soil inputs

Function used `ReadInputSoil()`

##### Description
The ReadInputSoil function reads soil property data from an input file and processes it for further use in the model. It extracts information on soil texture (sand, silt, and clay proportions), organic carbon content, bulk density, pH, and cation exchange capacity (CEC), among other parameters. The function also computes key soil properties, such as saturated soil water content (Sat_SWC) and residual soil water content (Res_SWC), using pedotransfer functions based on the selected water retention curve model.

The function processes soil properties layer by layer and applies empirical formulas to estimate soil hydraulic properties.
If additional field data (e.g., pH, organic content, bulk density, CEC) is available, it can be used to refine soil parameter estimations.
If no local soil data is provided, default soil parameters should be taken from global datasets, as suggested in Marthews et al. (2014).
The function logs the number of soil layers read and prints computed values for verification.

##### Functionalities
- Opens and reads the soil input file (inputfile_soil).

- Extracts the following soil layer attributes:
    - Layer thickness (m) 
    - Texture proportions: Silt (%), Clay (%), Sand (%)
    - Soil organic carbon (SOC) (% â†’ converted to gC/kg)
    - Dry bulk density (DBD) (g/cmÂ³)
    - pH
    - Cation exchange capacity (CEC) (cmol/kg)

- Computes cumulative soil depth for each layer.

- Calculates soil hydrological properties based on the _WATER_RETENTION_CURVE setting:
    If _WATER_RETENTION_CURVE == 1: Uses Hodnett & Tomasella (2002) functions for tropical soils.
    If _WATER_RETENTION_CURVE == 0: Uses Tomasella & Hodnett (1998) texture-based pedotransfer functions.

- Computes:
    - Saturated soil water content (Sat_SWC) (mÂ³/mÂ³)
    - Maximum soil water capacity (Max_SWC) (mÂ³)
    - Field capacity (FC_SWC)
    - Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) (mm/s or kg/mÂ²/s)
    - Residual soil water content (Res_SWC)
    - Minimum soil water capacity (Min_SWC) (mÂ³)

- Allocates memory dynamically for soil parameter arrays and checks for allocation errors.

### Water availability

Function used `Water_availability()`

#### Description

### Update Field (bucket model, update seeds, recruit Tree)
Function used `UpdateField()`

#### Description
The UpdateField() function advances the simulation by one time step. It updates daily climate variables, models neighborhood-based ecological interactions, handles tree recruitment, calculates the field's leaf area index (LAI), and simulates soil water dynamics (if enabled), including processes like interception, throughfall, evaporation, transpiration, runoff, and leakage. It also updates soil water potential based on the soil water content and a chosen water retention model.

#### Functionalities
- Its primary responsibility is to update various environmental and biological state variables within the simulated field for a single time step.

- Climate Data Assimilation:
    - reads daily climate variables (night temperature, precipitation, daily mean wind speed, daily mean irradiance, daily mean temperature, and daily mean vapor pressure deficit) from arrays.
    - The modulo operator (%) is used to cycle through the daily data.

- Possibility of declaring reduced precipitation (and others) experiments

- call UpdateSeeds()

- Neighborhood Density Dependence (NDD):

      If _NDD is true, it calculates a neighborhood density dependence field (t_NDDfield) for each site and species. It iterates through each site and then through a defined neighborhood (radius Rndd) around that site. This code block calculates, for each location in the field and for each species, a measure of neighborhood influence. This influence is based on the basal area of neighbors within a specific radius. The idea is that the presence and size of neighboring plants can affect the growth, survival, or other processes occurring at the central location.
      For each "site" in the field, it iterates through its neighbors within a defined radius (`Rndd`). If a neighbor is established (has a positive age), its basal area (proportional to the square of its diameter, `t_dbh`) contributes to the `t_NDDfield` of the central site, specific to the neighbor's species (`t_sp_lab`). This contribution is scaled by a normalization factor (`normBA`). Essentially, it quantifies how the size and proximity of neighboring entities influence each location in the field for each species present.


- Recruitment:

      It calls a function RecruitTree(), which handles the introduction of new individuals (e.g., seedlings) into the simulated field.

- Leaf Area Index (LAI) Calculation:

      It initializes a 3D leaf area index field (LAI3D).
      It calls a CalcLAI() method for each tree (T[site].CalcLAI()), implying that individual trees contribute to the overall LAI at different heights.
      It then cumulatively sums the LAI from the canopy top downwards, resulting in a vertical profile of LAI.

- Water Cycle Processes (if WATER is defined):

      It initializes various hydrological variables for each "dcell": runoff, interception, throughfall, evaporation, leakage, and  it also initializes LAI/canopy height related variables for dcells.

- LAI(average) at height h in dcell
      It calculates the average LAI at different heights (LAI_DCELL) and the average canopy   height (Canopy_height_DCELL) for each dcell based on the trees within that dcell.
      It estimates the wind speed at the top of the canopy (TopWindSpeed_DCELL) based on the daily mean wind speed and the canopy height, using a logarithmic or exponential relationship depending on whether the canopy height is below or above a meteorological station height.

- Soil water dynamics using a "bucket model":
      - Water Uptake: Reduces soil water content (SWC3D) based on tree transpiration (Transpiration).

      - Evaporation: Calculates and subtracts evaporation from the top soil layer based on a physically based model involving vapor pressure deficits, soil and air temperatures, and resistances (soil and aerodynamic).

      - Refilling by Rainfall: Calculates interception by the canopy and adds the remaining throughfall to the soil water content, prioritizing upper soil layers. If the topsoil is saturated, excess water becomes runoff.

      - Leakage: Accounts for water leaving the bottom of the soil profile.

      - Water Table Effect: If _WATER_TABLE is enabled, it sets the soil water content in layers below the water table depth (WTD) to the maximum water holding capacity.

      - It updates the soil water potential (soil_phi3D) and hydraulic conductivity (Ks, KsPhi) based on the current soil water content

##### **\_Water table depth - fixed values version\_**

This version introduces the option to include a fixed water table depth (WTD) in the model, with three configuration modes:

1. No WTD â€“ original soil water dynamics.

2. Shallow WTD â€“ last three soil layers are saturated.

3. Deep WTD â€“ only the last soil layer is saturated.

- Possible tests:
  - vary layers depths
  - vary layers soil composition

###### Water Table Depth Definitions
Soil layers from surface to bottom:

| Layer | Thickness (m) | Cumulative Depth (m) |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1     | 0.10           | 0.10                 |
| 2     | 0.23           | 0.33                 |
| 3     | 0.40           | 0.73                 |
| 4     | 0.80           | 1.53                 |
| 5     | 0.97           | 2.50                 |

Water table depth settings:

- Shallow WTD: below the top two layers â†’ WTD = 0.33 m

- Deep WTD: below the top four layers â†’ WTD = 1.53 m

###### Code implementations

1. WTD on and off 

Control the water table feature via the a parameter in the input_global file:

```cpp
_WATER_TABLE = 0 // disables water table
_WATER_TABLE = 1 // enables water table
```
If _WATER_TABLE = 1, the model will simulate soil water content based on a fixed water table depth.

2. Soil water saturation depending on WTD

- Inside bucket model:

```cpp
if (_WATER_TABLE == 1){ /// WTD on
  int l=0; // layer counter
  while((l<nblayers_soil)) {
    //if the depth of the layer is higher than the wtd, the amount of water in the layer (SWC3D) is = max of water the soil layer can hold
    if(layer_depth[l]>WTD){
      SWC3D[l][d] = Max_SWC[l];
    }
      l++;
  }
}

```
